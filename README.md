Tim is a confident front-end web developer with experience in back-end & software development who also offers impartial advice on web solutions. A perpetual learner with a genuine passion for technology, science, learning and DIY.

I've been working with technology from a very young age and have been writing code professionally since 2014. In this time, the majority of my roles have focussed on developing new and existing products and services, utilising front-end technologies as well as opportunities to work with back-end technologies on occasion. I've also worked on tools for process automation and streamlining processes using various desktop technologies.

The technologies I leverage the most in my time writing code would include HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, XML, GIT, Moodle, SCORM.

Some other skills I have used along the way but have less experience with would include ReactJS, NodeJS, PHP, C#, VSB, Bash/PowerShell, Adobe CC suite.

I can usually be found playing around and experimenting on Debian (home server), Pop!_OS (personal/gaming machine) and RaspianOS (for various Pi's), as well as Windows 10 (work laptop) for my main development tasks.

Likes: writing code, solving puzzles, telling jokes, playing bass guitar, DIY projects, and enthusing about science, electronics & technology.

Dislikes: being late, being untidy or unorganised, using/developing for Internet Explorer, tab VS spaces, odd numbers.
